## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design approach: "аккуратный дизайн" (neat/tidy) minimalist design with clean, professional styling.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend utilizes a Vanilla JavaScript approach for core functionality, prioritizing fast loading and minimal dependencies through modular design. Styling combines custom CSS with Tailwind utility classes for responsive design and consistent theming. The platform employs progressive enhancement, ensuring core features are accessible without JavaScript, with interactive elements layered on top. UI/UX design patterns include typewriter animations, card-based layouts with hover effects, interactive dropdowns, and a mobile-responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox with the Inter font family. The platform has undergone complete rebranding to InBack.ru. All pages utilize a `base.html` template for consistent styling.

**Recent Updates (August-September 2025):**
- Implemented unified blue corporate design for all district cards
- Mass updated 40+ district cards to consistent styling with from-blue-600 to-blue-700 gradients  
- Fixed district link routing issues - corrected 25 mismatched URL patterns
- Enhanced card structure with improved typography, icons, and hover animations
- **Database Integration Enhancement (September 2025)**: Connected "Эксклюзивные предложения" block to dynamically load only the best 6 residential complexes from database with smart filtering (excludes "IV кв. 2025 г. Строится" developments), ensuring full data consistency with /residential-complexes page including photos, buildings, and apartments data
- **Manager Presentation System (September 12, 2025)**: Created internal presentation view page at `/manager/presentation/<id>` inside manager dashboard with complete functionality matching user requirements - includes action buttons (email sharing, download all, link generation), social media integration (Telegram, WhatsApp, VK), property management controls, and robust API integration
- **Manager Favorites System (September 17, 2025)**: Implemented complete favorites functionality for managers with database models (ManagerFavoriteProperty, ManagerFavoriteComplex), API endpoints (/api/manager/favorites/*), and UI integration in manager dashboard. Fixed critical CSS visibility bug where global `.hidden` class was breaking site header and UI elements - replaced with scoped `.manager-favorites-hidden` class for targeted component control
- **Unified Favorites System (September 18, 2025)**: Completed unification of favorites functionality - existing user favorite buttons now automatically work for both regular users and managers without separate interfaces. Implemented centralized user type detection via `FavoritesManager.isManager()`, fixed API endpoint routing for managers, and eliminated conflicts between legacy localStorage and new API systems. All favorites interactions now use consistent logic and appropriate backend endpoints based on user type
- **Comparison Page Enhancement (September 24, 2025)**: Resolved all critical comparison page issues - fixed race condition where buildPropertiesComparison called before data loading, corrected HTTP method from POST to DELETE for removal API endpoints, eliminated unwanted tab switching after deletion, and ensured external URL access functions identically to internal Replit environment. Comparison removal now works in database (not just localStorage) with confirmed API responses {"success":true}
- **Insurance System Integration (September 25, 2025)**: Implemented comprehensive insurance system to replace "transaction support" in mortgage menu. Created complete `/insurance` page based on external example with InBack branding, featuring insurance calculator, application forms, and detailed information sections. Integrated CSRF-protected email handling via SendGrid for insurance applications, with professional HTML email templates. Updated navigation menu "Ипотека" → "Помощь и поддержка" replacing "Сопровождение сделки" with "Страхование". System includes full server-side validation, error handling, and security measures ready for production use

### Data Architecture
Property and residential complex information is stored in structured JSON files, with a normalized structure using relational IDs, designed for easy transition to a relational database.

### Map Integration
Interactive property maps are powered by Leaflet.js, utilizing OpenStreetMap tiles. Features include marker clustering for efficient display of multiple properties and coordinate-based filtering for location-based search.

### Search and Filtering System
The platform offers multi-criteria filtering (price range, room count, developer, location) and real-time search without page reloads. Smart search, integrated with PostgreSQL, provides real-time, categorized suggestions (districts, developers, complexes, streets, room types) via an API endpoint, with JavaScript-powered autocomplete. It includes a favorites system for bookmarking properties and tools for side-by-side property comparison.

### Business Logic
Core business logic includes dynamic cashback calculation based on property prices, property status tracking, structured data for real estate developers, and a comprehensive apartment selection system within residential complexes.

### System Design Choices
Comprehensive SEO optimization is implemented, including meta-tags, JSON-LD structured data, XML sitemap, `robots.txt`, and canonical URLs, specifically geo-targeted for Krasnodar. Features include an animated favorites system with `localStorage` persistence, a unified comparison page for properties and residential complexes, consistent modern button styling, and a personalized, role-based manager interface with quick action widgets and real-time statistics. The system also includes a planned hierarchical structure for `Developer → Residential Complex → Building → Apartments`.
